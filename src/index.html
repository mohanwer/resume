                An application that provides features similar to meetup.com. In a nutshell, users have the ability to create/host events.
                Other users can then search and sign up for events near them. This application is broken into seperate projects for the backend
                and front end. My primary focus is on backend so that portion is has a greater number of features.

                    Additionally created helper classes to ease the burden of creating key objects such as users accounts / purchases.
                    Set a requirement for backend developers to write tests cases for new features developed.

                    Personally developed all aspects of this feature: api, stored procedures, and UI components.

                  <li>
                    Conceptualized and created an oracle data warehouse (called <span class="font-bold">Bayou</span>) to hold medical device data in a central location.
                    Data was originally stored various locations across the company in numerous formats (hadoop / BI Tools / Sql Server / excel files).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Created pipelines using python to ETL data from various locations into Bayou (data warehouse). Data ETLs executed multiple times a day with extensive
                    logging to track the outcome and history of individual ETLs. Regularly updated data led greater visibility of operational metrics and led to
                    performance increases in numerous departments by 30-50%.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Created templates / examples in <span class="font-bold">python</span> and R for training data scientist / analyst on how to connect and query. Analysts had different
                    techniques for organizing and managing data to analyse. Allowed standardizing of many analytical techniques across the quality division.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Developed dozens of materialized views to structure / normalize data imported from numerous backend sources. Views allowed users like data scientist / business analysis / tableau users
                    to access and analyze complex medical data consistently.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Developed an ASP.net application to query and obtain basic reports from Bayou for lay users. Web application also had dashboards developed using
                    <span class="font-bold">D3.js</span> to visualize KPI for several department.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Automated generation of dozens of statistical reports using python. Eliminated 40+ hours of labor per month in generating reports.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Served as subject matter expert for  related questions during FDA audits.
